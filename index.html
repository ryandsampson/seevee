  <h1>neRDS Inc.</h1>
  <p><em>The Roanoke Valley's premier full service technology company.</em></p>
  <hr>
  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>neRDS was spiritually formed in 2014, when our founder Ryan Sampson first began working on computers for his
    friends and family. He took this foundational start and ran with it. With his extensive background in Service Industry
    jobs, he knew how to treat a customer, especially if you wanted them to bring their business back, and he incorporated that
    into his philosophy. neRDS Inc. was officially founded in late 2019 and has since exploded into popularity across the entire
    Roanoke and New River Valley area. If you'd like to speak with us, or set up a service call, click <a href="contactus.html">here</a>.</p>
